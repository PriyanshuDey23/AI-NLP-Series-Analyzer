Yes, precious things are never in shape  You never know what it is when you get it or lose it  Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength  Even if you get lost, let's start walking  One more time  That darn Naruto\\u2026  Zero Motivation: The Guy with Cloud Envy!  \\u2013 C\\u2019mon! \\u2013 Hurry up with the match!  Finish it up already!  Stand up and start the match!  Evidently, people don\\u2019t want to see the minor players\\u2019 matches  since they were really looking forward to Sasuke\\u2019s match\\u2026  If people aren't expecting anything exciting from this battle,  makes no sense for me to have it.  What? You\\u2019re giving up, too?  My opponent\\u2019s a girl again?  Hey, why aren\\u2019t you moving?!  C'mon, get started!  That kid has had zero fighting spirit from the beginning\\u2026  C\\u2019mon! What is he doing?!  C\\u2019mon Shikamaru! Get it together and do it!  If you don\\u2019t come, I\\u2019ll go!  Hey! Haven\\u2019t started yet\\u2026  Man, that girl is so gung-ho.  It doesn\\u2019t really matter if I become a Chunin or not.  But there's no reason why a man should lose to a woman.  Well\\u2026 let\\u2019s do it!  This guy\\u2019s quick to run away\\u2026  Nor any reason why a man should rough up a woman.  But I don\\u2019t want to be roughed up either.  He\\u2019s the kind of Ninja that uses shadows.  Shadow Possession Jutsu.  He\\u2019s probably trying to lure me into the trees where there're lots of shadows\\u2026  but I won\\u2019t let him.  Why am I the only one who always gets a woman for an opponent, cripes?!  Shikamaru! You get her with a torrent of 16 combination\\u2026!  Mind if I sit here?  Huh?  What\\u2026you? Your stomach okay?  What? Wasn\\u2019t Sasuke\\u2019s match next?  Shh!  Everything\\u2019s fine, right, Sakura? After all, it's Sasuke, right?  R-Right now, I should leave her alone.  It looks like Shikamaru taking part in this final battle,  it seems like he's in the wrong place.  Don\\u2019t say that!  I certainly don\\u2019t think that he has any great techniques,  but that Shikamaru is always good at strategizing.  That\\u2019s why I feel like we ended up in the preliminary round the other day.  Hmm, yeah well\\u2026  And after all, he jumped down into the arena himself.  He seems uncharacteristically driven.  Even he can be passionate once in a while!  Go! Shikamaru!  Geez, I envy a cloud being so free\\u2026  I guess I pretty much am completely without desire\\u2026  Even the reason why I became a Ninja\\u2026  was because I thought I would have a fun life, ya know\\u2026  Get it together!  C\\u2019mon Shikamaru!  But\\u2026of course, it\\u2019s not that easy.  What\\u2019s going on with that stupid face?! ls he underestimating me?  Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!  That\\u2019s right, with this attack, my armed attacks also were beaten down.  I see\\u2026  Shadow Possession Jutsu! I\\u2019ve seen that true identity!  Evidently there\\u2019s a limit to the stretching and shortening,  changing shape of the shadow\\u2026  No matter how much you change the shape of the shadow,  even when you stretch it,  it can only span up to the size of your own shadow.  That\\u2019s right isn\\u2019t it?  You got it\\u2026  Even if I assume that he's made up the distance,  by stretching his shadow from the edge of the shadow of the arena wall\\u2026  This is the limit to how far the shadow can stretch.  This is the scope of his attack!  15 meters, 32 centimeters!  She took the distance with the folding fan.  Temari is stronger at long distance battles than she is at close range\\u2026  the outcome has already been decided.  What? What is that sign\\u2026?  That\\u2019s no sign. That\\u2019s like, his habit.  Habit\\u2026?  He enjoys passing time slowly. That guy\\u2019s like an old man.  That\\u2019s why he likes Japanese checkers and chess  and always makes me be his opponent.  When he\\u2019s stuck on a move, he always does that.  Why?  He\\u2019s working out his strategy.  And, I\\u2019ve never beaten him.  A strategy\\u2026 but this is an actual fight.  It\\u2019s different from a game.  But it's said that formation pieces that were used to build battle strategy  eventually become game pieces.  Shikamaru is like a brilliant general.  Wait a minute.  When we grouped the Genin, I saw his scores.  They were at about the same level of that Naruto\\u2019s.  He said that moving his pencil during written exams at the academy is a pain,  and during the tests, he always sleeps instead.  A pain\\u2026?  He was so good at strategy games, I felt something wasn\\u2019t right\\u2026  so I had him take an IQ test under the pretense that it was a game.  And\\u2026 how did it turn out?... \\u2026  He was more than brilliant.  With an IQ of over 200, he\\u2019s a super genius!  T-Two hundred?!  He\\u2019s done thinking\\u2026 lt starts now.  Looks like you\\u2019ve got some fighting spirit now\\u2026  It\\u2019s pointless to hide!  I wonder if he\\u2019s really got a strategy\\u2026  M-Maybe\\u2026  With that he has no approach!  Shikamaru! Go for it!  It\\u2019s pointless, isn\\u2019t it?  He\\u2019ll give up soon.  He hates things that are a pain in the butt.  You're wrong! At least, I hope so\\u2026  But you may be right\\u2026  How long are you going to run away! Cut it out!  It\\u2019s no use.  As long as I\\u2019m on the outside of this line,  he absolutely can\\u2019t catch me\\u2026  No, wait! Close call!  You caught on well.  So you were dragging your feet to wait for the sun to set\\u2026  in order to make the surface of your own shadow larger  by stretching the shadow line of the wall.  As the sun goes down, the shadows lengthen.  Isn't that so?  That was close! Shikamaru\\u2026  But why is he using shadows?  After all, Shikamaru is inside the shadow of the field.  If there\\u2019s even a little bit of light, he can make a shadow within a shadow!  You don\\u2019t know a thing about Shikamaru!  A shadow\\u2026in a shadow\\u2026?  Even if I calculate the height of the sun now  and the limit to the distance of the previous attack,  there's no mistaking the distance!  Temari! Up!  I see.  What\\u2019s this?!  Darn it!  I won\\u2019t let you escape!  I didn\\u2019t expect that he would create extra shadows to reach me  by making a parachute with his jacket\\u2026!  He\\u2019s impressive.  Once I notice the parachute from above, I\\u2019ll take my attention off from my feet.  That\\u2019s a sneaky trick to catch me off my guard!  However, now it\\u2019s clear.  Shadow Possession Jutsu is  one in which other shadows are used to get your opponent,  a skillful technique!  She\\u2019s dodged this trick too\\u2026  Not careful enough in the final stage.  And his opponent is fairly analytical.  She\\u2019s good at thinking ahead.  If this battle takes too long,  the shadows in the arena will grow, and his territory will increase.  I\\u2019ll defeat him with the next one!  Should I make a diversion with Clone Jutsu\\u2026?  Now his shadow is\\u2026  Okay!  Clone\\u2026  N-No way\\u2026!  My... body is\\u2026?!  At last\\u2026 Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!  What?!  What\\u2019s going on\\u2026?  That boy\\u2026  How much is he planning ahead\\u2026?  That\\u2019s Shikamaru\\u2019s skill.  Why\\u2026won\\u2019t my body move?!  The shadow shouldn\\u2019t have reached this far.  I'll let you take a look behind you\\u2026  T-This hole\\u2026!  You saw it too, didn\\u2019t you\\u2026?  That hole is the hole Naruto burrowed and flew out of.  So it\\u2019s connected to the big hole in front of you.  I didn\\u2019t expect that\\u2026 a shadow in a tunnel of a hole\\u2026  Right.  Pure and simple, a calculated chess move.  So his purpose to make Temari measure the limit of the shadow several times  was to lead her to his final trick of using this hole.  Temari battled on the outside of the limit of the shadow  that she measured and followed,  but he caught her from behind, trailed by the shadow she couldn\\u2019t see\\u2026  There is no escape from this.  I-It can\\u2019t be\\u2026  The attack that he used with the jacket,  was it a device to lead me to right this spot\\u2026?  Was that an underplot too?!  Why that--?!  Checkmate with the next one.  My body is moving on its own! I can\\u2019t resist it!  Before anyone knew it, they fell under the spell of this match.  That guy with no mark is quite a darkhorse.  Yes! You did it!  Go! Shikamaru!  Check\\u2026  Good grief\\u2026 I give up!  What?!  See I told you\\u2026he\\u2019d give up.  Ino doesn\\u2019t know anything about Shikamaru.  W-What did you say?!  I\\u2019ve used too much Chakra from Shadow Possession Jutsu in rapid succession.  I can\\u2019t hold it another 10 seconds.  I thought of the next trick 200 times.  But I\\u2019m out of time\\u2026  This has become such a pain.  Doing one match is good\\u2026  That guy is a strange one.  The winner is Temari!  One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks  Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says \\u201cI LOVE YOU\\u201d  Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry  Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

Hate to admit it, but I'm looking forward to it myself.  Hey, Shikamaru. I can't hear what you said.  There's not a single person who's not excited about the featured battle.  Next: \\\"Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand\\\"  I can't take my eyes away from this battle! \",\n          \"Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength  Even if you get lost, let\\u2019s start walking  One more time  Are you really happy  when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?

Yes, precious things are never in shape  You never know what it is when you get it or lose it  Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength  Even if you get lost, let's start walking  One more time  So what\\u2019s up, Temari?  He\\u2019s close. He\\u2019s just right there.  Dang it! What should we do?  Leave it to me.  That was close.  What was that noise?  An explosion\\u2026 Perhaps it was a trap set for Sasuke.  I wonder if he\\u2019s okay.  Don\\u2019t worry\\u2026 He wouldn\\u2019t get bumped off so easily.  I sure hope so.  Now then, shall we get started?  Before that, I must have you both return to your original forms.  Please prepare yourself, Sarutobi Sensei.  An Unrivaled Match: Hokage Battle Royale!  With every moment, they are looking more lively\\u2026  What is that\\u2026Jutsu?  Reanimation.  It\\u2019s a Forbidden Summoning Jutsu that can bring the dead back to this world.  The cost of a regular Summoning Jutsu is that it uses the blood of the caster.  But I\\u2019ve heard that with this Jutsu,  in order to summon a dead soul to this world\\u2026  the body of a living person is sacrificed as a container for the soul.  Then, the bodies of those two are of the sacrificed\\u2026  Right\\u2026  Perhaps dust and dirt cover the sacrificial body  and take on the original form of the summoned soul.  And by way of the charm embedded in the head,  the personality of the soul is killed  and it morphs into no more than a killing puppet.  They\\u2019re complete.  They look like how they used to look more than ever.  Do you know the joy and sense of accomplishment  of hurting one whom you once called Sensei?  I prepared this scenario so that you might know that joy.  So please enjoy it.  Lord Hokage!  Even if the shape and form are the same\\u2026  they\\u2019re neither the First Hokage nor the Second!  I\\u2026know!  Here I go!  Fire Style: Fire Dragon Flame Bombs.  Water Style: Water Wall.  No way!  To be able to set into motion that level of Water Style in a place with no water.  I can\\u2019t believe it.  True to the title of the previous Hokage.  Water Style: Water Shock Wave!  Earth Style: Mud Wall.  Same mighty strength as always.  Having two of you is quite a challenge, as might be expected\\u2026  This is bad.  This is a Hidden Jutsu of the First Hokage.  Hidden Wood Style Jutsu:  Deep Forest Emergence.  His Chakra became a source for life.  Wow\\u2026 So this is the legendary Wood Style Ninjutsu of the First Hokage  who brought turbulent times under control and built the Leaf Village.  You\\u2019re finally caught\\u2026eh, Sensei.  Okay. Everyone\\u2019s here, right?  Okay everyone, let\\u2019s evacuate quickly.  Don\\u2019t rush and don\\u2019t panic!  What\\u2019s the matter, Konohamaru?  Does your stomach hurt or something?  No\\u2026it\\u2019s not that.  Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu.  Appear!  Monkey King Enma.  Humph\\u2026 Something pesky has appeared, eh?  Old Monkey Enma.  Orochimaru\\u2026 I knew this would happen.  You\\u2019re pathetic, Sarutobi\\u2026 lt\\u2019s because you didn\\u2019t kill him back then.  I\\u2019m going to do it now!  It\\u2019s too late.  Please\\u2026Enma! The Adamantine Nyoi.  Take care of him. Don\\u2019t let him transform into that!  Okay\\u2026 Got it!  Transform!  All right.  Wow\\u2026 What level of Ninjutsu battle!  This is Hokage level!  Oh well\\u2026 Things have finally gotten interesting.  That's one of his Snake Swords.  Let\\u2019s do it, Enma!  No matter how strong the body, the Snake Sword still hurts.  You\\u2019re mine!  Lord Hokage!  So foolish\\u2026  To think you\\u2019d strike without even using the Shadow Clone Jutsu.  No, that\\u2019s not it.  It's not that he didn't use it. He can\\u2019t use it.  The amount of Chakra the Third Hokage has differs from the past.  The Shadow Clone Jutsu that evenly disperses Chakra,  if things go wrong, would be like throwing away Chakra.  Sure enough, is it age?!  Are you okay, Sensei?  Please hang in there.  You are called\\u2026  \\u201cthe Professor who knows and uses all of the Jutsu existent in Leaf Village,\\u201d right?  Please don\\u2019t disappoint me too much.  Please get up, Lord Hokage\\u2026!  And please save the Leaf Village!  Lord Hokage!  Fool\\u2026 It is too late.  Sarutobi, what\\u2019s wrong?  You\\u2019re not your usual self.  It\\u2019s as if you\\u2019re good for nothing\\u2026 What are you hesitating for?  Now\\u2019s the time to draw the line.  Orochimaru\\u2026  You\\u2026fool!  Orochimaru\\u2026  This is the end.  I\\u2019ll snap your neck.  As I thought\\u2026  It looks like there\\u2019s no point if I don\\u2019t do something about the soul itself  that is bound by the Reanimation.  If so, all I can do is to use\\u2026 the Fourth Hokage\\u2019s Jutsu.  Lord First Hokage, Lord Second Hokage, please forgive me for using that Jutsu!  Sensei\\u2026it seems you\\u2019re out of breath.  You\\u2019ve gotten old, haven\\u2019t you?  I\\u2019ve never seen such a pained look.  What\\u2019s so funny?  It\\u2019s quite sad\\u2026  Old age beats even you, once renowned as the god of Shinobi.  What\\u2019s that\\u2026?! What the heck is going on?  Who the heck is that youth?  Who the heck are you?!  Is it so sudden you can\\u2019t tell?  It\\u2019s me. Orochimaru.  It can\\u2019t be\\u2026  Have you completed that Forbidden Jutsu?!  You\\u2019re a truly frightening, inhuman monster!  I finally caught up.  This is as far as you guys go.  Dang it!  Sasuke Uchiha.  I won\\u2019t let you get away now.  Everyone makes mistakes lt\\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about  Don\\u2019t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile  Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump  If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you  So many regrets Don\\u2019t let this scar be for naught  Let\\u2019s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it\\u2019s Show Time, life begins now.

I should be asking you that, Chishima.  You shouldn\\u2019t be moving with that injury.  I\\u2019m fine.  More importantly, we need to find Lady Toki.  Oh yeah, that\\u2019s right\\u2026  Where the hell did that Moso go?  I\\u2019m right here\\u2026  Moso\\u2026!  Lady Toki\\u2026!

Lady Toki\\u2026  I have fond memories\\u2026  of playing here at this lake\\u2026  with you and Lord Sagi.  In those days,  the Land of Bird was tranquil, gentle and warm\\u2026  Use your strength, Lady Toki\\u2026 to restore the Land of Birds\\u2026  to the way it was in those days\\u2026  Chishima\\u2026  Hang in there!

That guy was nothing more  than just another convenient servant, after all.  Shut up!  He loved the Land of Birds with all his might\\u2026  Chishima, who staked his life trying to protect the country he loved\\u2026  I will not\\u2026forgive you, no matter what!  You may say that you won\\u2019t forgive me,  but what exactly do you think you can do?!  Water Style: Giant Vortex Jutsu!  Die!  How annoyingly persistent!  Gentle Fist!  That was careless, Copy Ninja Kakashi Hatake\\u2026  The reputation of the Wandering Ninja will be upgraded  if I take you, who possess the Sharingan, down\\u2026  What\\u2026? A Substitution\\u2026  Sorry to disappoint you.  I don\\u2019t need to use the Sharingan on the likes of you\\u2026  This way!  Naruto!  If we follow this\\u2026  Yes, we should be able to reach Naruto.  Unfortunately, I cannot allow you to avenge the blood of the fallen.  The least I can do for you, out of charity,  is send you to the same place your father and brother are.  I don\\u2019t care.  Why don\\u2019t you just kill me in one stroke?  You know when to give up, huh?  They\\u2019re all dead. I\\u2019m the only one left in this world.  Now that I am unable to take revenge,  I have no more reason to live.  You\\u2019re a courageous girl, aren\\u2019t you?  All right, I\\u2019ll grant your wish.  Resign yourself!  Wake up.  Save Toki\\u2026 Save my little sister\\u2026  I entrusted the future of the Land of Birds to my younger sister  and gave her the watch.  But Toki became obsessed with her desire for revenge.  I, a dead soul, cannot change my younger sister\\u2019s heart  which is stalled in time.  I\\u2019m begging you,  please make my younger sister\\u2019s time begin to move again towards the future.  What was that just now?  Die!  What?  Hold it!  What?  Hold it!  Naruto!  I met your elder brother in a dream a little while ago.  Elder Brother?  It wasn\\u2019t the wish of your elder brother Sagi  that you avenge his death.  He wanted to leave the care of this land in your hands.  But\\u2026  For Chishima\\u2019s sake too\\u2026  you must make this Land of Bird a great country\\u2026  That\\u2019s why you must live, Toki\\u2026  Naruto\\u2026  It doesn\\u2019t make any difference to me.  The two of you are going to die here in any case.  Hey, Hoki, you want this Land, right?  What\\u2026  But a person with an impure heart, with a heart bent on revenge,  cannot govern this land.  The reason this was such a wonderful country was because  Chishima and Sagi and Toki\\u2019s hearts were all connected.  Even if you use dirty tricks to gain status,  you will never be able to control the hearts of the people\\u2026  Speak for yourself, squirt!  Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!  You Leaf Village greenhorn!  I\\u2019ll send you down into hell first to meet up with the others!

What\\u2026!  Let\\u2019s go!  \\u2013 Damn, which is the real one? \\u2013 Damn, which is the real one?  Naruto, hang in there\\u2026  I wouldn\\u2019t have thought the real McCoy would come straight out  when using Shadow Clones\\u2026  I was hoping you\\u2019d let me have some fun\\u2026  So that was your caliber, after all, huh.  Those without power should hurry up and die!  Better not underestimate me! The battle is not yet won!  You impertinent little\\u2026!  Now!  U-zu-ma-ki\\u2026  The real McCoy is\\u2026  Over here!  Uzumaki Barrage!  I did it!  Chishima!  Chishima\\u2026  Don\\u2019t die, Chishima!  Don\\u2019t\\u2026leave me\\u2026all alone!  Open your eyes\\u2026  Please!  Lady Toki\\u2026  Chishima\\u2026!  Lady Toki\\u2026  I\\u2019m so relieved!  Thank you, Naruto!  I was just carrying out my mission.  More importantly\\u2026  Make that guy pay dearly for his crimes, okay.  Yes.  I\\u2019m sure that Sagi is happy about this too.  You met\\u2026you met Elder Brother Sagi\\u2026  Yeah, in a dream.  But even if it was in a dream,  it doesn\\u2019t change the fact that he asked me to do something.  What did Elder Brother say to you?  Well, he said something about starting up your time again.  My time?  He said he wanted you to forget about things like revenge  and instead live for the future.  Elder Brother\\u2026  Hey!  Naruto\\u2026  Kakashi Sensei, Neji, Tenten!  Gimme a break\\u2026  I can\\u2019t get paid my extra money now that Moso,  the guy who signs the paycheck, got nabbed\\u2026  Come on, resign yourself\\u2026  But\\u2026  It looks like the Wandering Ninja are going to get a really stiff sentence.  Yeah\\u2026 And Toki was finally able to break the curse of seeking revenge\\u2026  Hey, it\\u2019s gonna start!  Down on your knees!  Ohhh\\u2026wow\\u2026  I must apologize for having deceived everyone  by using my brother\\u2019s name fraudulently,  and claiming the title of feudal lord.  In a case such as this,  it may well be proper to hand over the title of feudal lord to someone else.  However, if you will forgive me,  I would like to ask you to allow me to work  on behalf of Land of Birds as your lord.  For my deceased father Owashi, and brother Sagi\\u2026  And for my dear friend Chishima who loves this country so dearly\\u2026  Lady Toki\\u2026  As long as there is breath in my body,  I would like to work positively to rebuild this country.  She\\u2019s doing an excellent job, isn\\u2019t she?  Toki, awesome!  As you wish, Lady Toki\\u2026  It appears that you all agree too, correct?  \\u2013 Yes, sir! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Yes, sir!  Thank you\\u2026  To Komei\\u2026for accepting me as your feudal lord\\u2026to everyone\\u2026  And to the young Ninja who taught me  what it is that I should really stake my life on\\u2026  You\\u2019re embarrassing me\\u2026  Land of Birds  Please take the best of care along the road now.  Fare thee well.  Chishima, be nice to Toki, okay?  Thank you, Naruto.  Please come back to visit again soon.  Sure, next time I\\u2019d love to visit without a mission.  Goodbye.  Goodbye. Be well\\u2026  See you\\u2026  Toki\\u2026she was really kind and gorgeous too, wasn\\u2019t she?  I\\u2019m certain that the Land of Birds will become a wonderful land again,  just like it was in the old days.  Yeah.  By the way, Naruto\\u2026 did you really meet Sagi\\u2019s ghost?  You gotta be kidding.  There\\u2019s no such things as ghosts\\u2026 that was all in a dream.  I\\u2019m not so sure it was just a dream.  Wh-What the heck are you talking about?!  Do you remember that Cursed Warrior we cornered the very first time?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, he was empty inside.  Th-This\\u2026?  The inside of it is empty.  Yeah, but that was just sort of gimmick, right?  Some kind of string or piece of wire or something\\u2026  No, I definitely saw it with my Byakugan.  Now that you mention it,  you said there was no sign of life, right, Neji?  Yeah\\u2026I didn\\u2019t feel a speck of life from that Cursed Warrior.  In other words, there was a ghost there.  So that was a real ghost, after all?!  Calm down, Naruto.  That's not true\\u2026 That's not true!  Tell me that\\u2019s not true!  The wind blows, Ah\\u2026  The pain, The memories won\\u2019t disappear  What should be brought along?  Assemble them into a piece.

              "\"To think the Leaf’s reinforcements will be you of all people!  A man should always repay the debt he owes a woman.  Always the bothersome guy with the man and woman stuff!  Gaara and Kankuro are chasing after the guys who took our village girl.  Forget about here and head for them!  We’ve received information.  Gaara and Kankuro have entered their respective battles.  I see…  The shadow won’t reach, I guess…  Leaf Village’s two-man cells are just now heading there for back-up.  How well prepared.  It’s a pain,  but as long as we’re doing this, we’ll do it right.  We’ll do it perfectly without producing casualties!  Make sure you don’t cry in front of me this time.  Are you going to hold that over my head forever?  Just like a woman…  I-I feel like I don’t really have my place in this.  I’ll take care of all of you at once!  Here it comes!  Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands  The distance created between us became too big,  because we were always together  Your honest reply, “See you…”  coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.  If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying  Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side  Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands  I can feel it so close,  Our two hearts  Sealed Sand: The Counterattack!  To think you’d ask the Leaf Village for help…  I guess the Sand has lost the edge they used to have, huh?  Why are you here?  You know, dogs.  They’re not satisfied until a favor has been properly returned.  Especially this Akamaru!  A dog retuning a favor doesn’t have much of a ring to it!  Help is on the way to the other two as well.  You concentrate on this fight!  You’re giving me lip!  So you flies are gonna gang up on me, huh?  But you’re no match for my Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.  Eat this!  If your Chakra isn't built up, your sand is no big deal at all!  It’ll only be useful for blinding me at best!  It’s futile!  I feel it. Your Chakra is being sucked up.  What?! He was setting the sand in the gourd aside?!  I was being cautious, but he is much too strong.  Gaara Sensei!  Just what I’d expect from Gaara of the Sand.  He’s not called the ultimate weapon for nothing…  The ultimate…weapon?!  However, he cannot exceed our Ninja tools  forged in the Village of the Artisans!  Gaara!  Hey, he’s totally got the edge!  Do we have a chance to return the favor?  That’s incredible wind. What an amount of Chakra…  No, it seems that sword is amplifying her Chakra.  So she’s relying on that sword for all of her attack and defense, huh?  Anyway, we’ve got to slip within firing range for our Jutsu  and stop her movements!  Right.  Let’s go at once!  Annoying!  She’s attempting to maintain her distance just from Temari.  I see.  So she just wants to pay attention to the long range-type Temari and  blow us mid-range Jutsu users away with wind  before we can get close, huh…?  Now then, what should we do?  Man Beast Clone!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Crow!  – Arms! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t– Fang Over Fang!  Did you guys come to get in my way?!  We made sure to send you a signal, right?!  How could I tell?!  We don’t click at all?  Are you guys…messing around?!  Be more serious and die!  Talking nonsense!  Although I reduced the damage with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still…  Just what I’d expect of Gaara,  the Sand’s ultimate weapon who hosts the Shukaku…  But you’re already in our hands.  What should I do? She’s beyond the range of my Jutsu…  and I don’t see anything around here that could be used to extend my shadow.  Hey!  What’re you whispering about?  What’re you thinking?!  I’ll explain later, for crying out loud. Can you do it or not?  I suppose I could try, but…  What is it…?  What’s he doing?  Behold the terror of Ninja tools our village created.  What’s this Chakra?  This is a water vein!  I get it!  The lines connecting the point in the center and triangle isn’t a Barrier…  It’s a water vein!  Ninja Tool Barrier: Reverse Scale Formation… Activate!  Oh no!  Gaara Sensei!  The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation was a single point, Gaara from the start!  Our swords accurately pierce a water vein  and summon the water dragon.  Sand has sucked up a large amount of water  and has become as heavy as lead…  Now Gaara can no longer use sand.  Gaara!  – Gaara! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t– Calm down!  Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara!  That guy is?!  They’ll save Gaara, no matter what.  We need to concentrate on the enemy in front of us.  To think you’d choose a sandy area to fall on…  Just what I’d expect of Gaara of the desert…  However!  That’s as far as your useless resistance goes!  Leaf Hurricane!  A hero’s turn always comes late!  That’s right!  Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara!  Naruto…!  It seems you rushed to everyone during the Sasuke incident…  This time we’ve come to return the favor from that time.  So we’ll take that guy on!  You hurry to your student straight on!  To think he’d corner you this far…  – Lee! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t– Sakura!  Leave Gaara’s treatment to me! Lee, you go with Naruto!  – Sakura! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t– Got it!  Then I’ll be going first!  Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra!  I’ll suck up all of your Chakra!  I see. So this means we can’t release our regular power?  That doesn’t matter!  Even without Chakra, we’ve got fighting spirit!  Yes! We’ll go with that plus willpower!  Just as I thought.  That they haven’t launched anything during the fight thus far means  the two reinforcements don’t have long range-type Jutsu.  Then I’ll maintain this distance and…  you’ll die getting torn up by the wind!  While she’s distracted by Shikamaru and the others,  I’ll just go for it!  Mind Destruction…!  Ino!  Foolish girl. It’s useless to attempt to exploit an opening!  You little!  You won’t get close to me! I’ve read your range as well!  I don’t know about that…!  Ino! You stay right there!  I’m counting on you…!  Shino! Sakura!  There’s one wounded at the waterfall.  Tunneling Fang!  Now!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Oh…!  What’re you doing?!  Are you guys…mocking me?  After sucking up all of your Chakra, I’ll be returning the favor plenty!  The contusion treatment is complete.  But, the depletion of Chakra is overwhelming.  Contact from your friends…?  – Ino’s hurt?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t– Go!  Wha--?! But in your condition…  I’m okay now. Help your friend!  Okay. Don’t push yourself.  Yeah…  What’re you doing?! Hurry up and go after your comrade!  I’ll help my comrade.  I’ll settle this in a moment.  But…  Bushy Brow!  Damn it. It’s no good just shot-gunning it!  It’s just him?  A part of Black Ant…  Could it be…a signal?  Fang Over Fang once more!  Back me up with Crow!  I’m counting on you for back up too, Choji!  Got it!  Heh! Bossing me around.  The counterattack starts now!  It’s futile. Your Jutsu won’t reach me!  You never know until you try, right…?!  Here we go!  Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe!  Huh?!  What’re you aiming at?! Totally misguided…  Say what?  What’s the meaning of this?  I’m sure I’d read your range already…!  I’ll show you!  I can create a shadow with this thick a current  even if the water’s clear.  My Jutsu’s range has infinitely improved by lifting the waterfall!  The Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!  Summoning…  Blade Dance!  This one’s done!  Good grief…  I…couldn’t do anything.  Here everyone’s doing their best…  Only I…  Ino?  Gaara.  You don’t have any sand left you can use.  What’s this?!  He smashed the Sand Armor.  No way! But the sand heavy with water like that…  If I just suck up the Chakra…  This is my weapon!  You okay, Gaara?!  This is the finishing blow…  Gaara Sensei!  Hurry! Leave the rest to us!  Man Beast Clone!  Fang Over Fang!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Annoying buzzing flies!  Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword!  What?!  Oh, no!  Puppet Show…  Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!  The show’s  over!  – We did it! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t– Yeah!  Matsuri.  Gaara and…!  A Shinobi carrying a child on his back.  He’s heading for the valley.  The last one…  Gaara is chasing him!  What?!  You okay, Bushy Brow? Sakura will be right back.  Thanks.  Well, I’m going after Gaara!  Got it! I’ll meet up with you later!  I’ve got him cornered.  Matsuri.  The Key to the rusted heart’s door  Will always be smiling right near by  Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it  Because I want to find the joy without a shape  This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,  I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds  We stand here today because of what we believed through,  That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away  Even if I’m told that there is no bright future  I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling  The wind is probably testing our hearts  In my heart, I gently grasped my hands  You are probably searching for the answer to your tears  Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands  The Key to the rusted heart’s door  Will always be smiling right near by  I heard you figured out the identities of the Four Celestials?  Yes. They are the Ninja of the Village of the Artisans  who've been harboring ill feeling toward the Five Great Nations.  It seems they’ve completed the forbidden project  passed down in the village and  intend to resurrect their ultimate weapon.  I see. I take it the other villagers got wind of it and evacuated.  Exactly. You head over to where they are immediately.  Yes, ma’am.  Next time: “The Ultimate Weapon Reborn” \""

Please hurry up with preparation for Summoning.  I want to be sure we\\u2019re able to make our move at any time.  Understood!  All right, I\\u2019ll leave that to you.  D-Don\\u2019t tell me that\\u2026  The reason I decided to train Sasuke was\\u2026  because he was like me.  A physical Activation?!  I see\\u2026  That\\u2019s why he went through the physical training  and increased his speed significantly\\u2026!  That\\u2019s right!  Awesome\\u2026  The Chakra is clearly visible to the naked eye\\u2026  What in the world is happening?!  Don\\u2019t tell me that he learned that Jutsu\\u2026!  So this is the Uchiha Clan\\u2026  Exactly\\u2026  W-What the heck is that?!  What a sound! What\\u2019s that technique?  That\\u2019s just a jab\\u2026  Huh?!  However, it is the one used by Leaf Village\\u2019s number one technician.  That\\u2019s the only original technique of the Copy Ninja, Kakashi\\u2026  It\\u2019s the special technique used only for assassinations\\u2026  Its secret is in the speed of the jab,  and also the physical aptitude that gives forth a gigantic Chakra,  the ability of the Chakra to focus solely on the target,  and moreover the speed of the jab makes a \\u201cchichichichichi\\u201d sound\\u2026  A unique sound attack similar to the rumbling of a thousand birds.  And that\\u2019s why that technique is called\\u2026  Chidori: One Thousand Birds!  No way! That Gaara\\u2019s absolute protection is\\u2026  It\\u2019s impossible\\u2026  Don\\u2019t tell me\\u2026  Excellent work\\u2026  That\\u2019s\\u2026  Kakashi\\u2019s\\u2026  Chidori\\u2026 Also known as Lightning Blade.  Lightning Blade?  Lightning Blade is another name for the Jutsu derived  from Kakashi\\u2019s ability to cut through lightning using that technique.  Huh? Cut through lightning?  Huh? That sounds fishy\\u2026  A-Awesome\\u2026  The real name of that technique is Chidori\\u2026  The secret is the speed of his jab that surpasses any human limitations  and the intensity of the Chakra on his arm\\u2026  And that arm turns virtually into the equivalent of the swing  of a celebrated sword that cuts through everything.  But what a reckless technique\\u2026  That\\u2019s not for you to say\\u2026  Right, Lee?  It\\u2019s beyond my scope of comprehension, but\\u2026  What an awesome technique!  I can understand it\\u2026  If it were me, if I made a running start at that speed,  I wouldn\\u2019t make a direct jab attack on the opponent\\u2026  Or rather, I couldn\\u2019t.  For an opponent,  a straight line attack just gives him an easy chance to launch a counterblow.  And moreover, I don\\u2019t have the eyes to read that counterblow.  I envy you\\u2026Sasuke!  When I fought you once, I said\\u2026  Even if one understands visually,  it\\u2019s meaningless unless one can move physically\\u2026  I was filled with a feeling of superiority.  But now, you have a body that moves at the same high speed as mine.  Moreover, you have\\u2026  the Sharingan!  I caught you!  Third Squadron. We are ready any time.  All preparations are complete on this end too.  Roger. Proceed with action at the signal.  Looks like it\\u2019s almost time.  The guy who was worrying about Sasuke until just a moment ago\\u2026  is now jealous of him.  Sasuke\\u2026  This is the feeling!  Summoning Jutsu!  I\\u2019ve gotten stronger\\u2026  In order to become Hokage\\u2026  In order not to lose to anyone\\u2026  Sasuke!  In order not to lose to you.  I want\\u2026to fight you, too.  But you are\\u2026  Yeah\\u2026  What\\u2026? This warm thing\\u2026?  Mother\\u2026? What is\\u2026?  Blood\\u2026my blood is\\u2026!  D-Don\\u2019t tell me that\\u2026  D-Don\\u2019t tell me that Gaara is hurt?!  What is it?!  It\\u2019s that thing\\u2019s arm!  Darn! Doing something careless like that\\u2026  Has the Perfect Possession happened?  I don\\u2019t know. He seems to be injured\\u2026  This has never happened before.  It gives me the chills just to remember\\u2026  When I first saw that thing, I wasn\\u2019t able to eat\\u2026  I mean, visually it\\u2019s totally\\u2026  What is\\u2026  this sensation?  He\\u2019s hurt, after all\\u2026  The shell was broken when his body was incomplete!  It\\u2019s different! Those aren\\u2019t the eyes!  W-What was that\\u2026 that look earlier on?!  Huh\\u2026?  What\\u2019s this\\u2026? I can\\u2019t see\\u2026  Kakashi! This must be!  Yeah\\u2026a Genjutsu!  \\u2013 Release! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Release!  What\\u2019s going on\\u2026?  Release!  Genjutsu! ls Kabuto already moving?  In that case, it\\u2019s just about time\\u2026  It\\u2019s coming!  Shall we begin?!  It\\u2019s the signal!  \\u2013 Start the operation! \\u2013 Start the operation!  Everyone makes mistakes lt\\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about  Don\\u2019t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile  Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump  If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you  So many regrets Don\\u2019t let this scar be for naught  Let\\u2019s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it\\u2019s Show Time, life begins now.  Everyone makes mistakes  It\\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about  Don\\u2019t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile  Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on  Forge on strong  It got dark all of a sudden\\u2026 it feels so good.  I hear something in the distance.  Sakura\\u2019s voice, Kakashi Sensei\\u2019s voice\\u2026  Scream? I just heard something loud.  I think I do, but\\u2026 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSasuke\\u2026  I got to watch his match!  But I really don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on.  Next time: \\u201cZero Hour! The Destruction of \\t\\tthe Hidden Leaf Village Begins!\\u201d  What in the world is going on?! \",\n          \"To think the Leaf\\u2019s reinforcements will be you of all people!  A man should always repay the debt he owes a woman.  Always the bothersome guy with the man and woman stuff!  Gaara and Kankuro are chasing after the guys who took our village girl.  Forget about here and head for them!  We\\u2019ve received information.  Gaara and Kankuro have entered their respective battles.  I see\\u2026  The shadow won\\u2019t reach, I guess\\u2026  Leaf Village\\u2019s two-man cells are just now heading there for back-up.  How well prepared.  It\\u2019s a pain,  but as long as we\\u2019re doing this, we\\u2019ll do it right.  We\\u2019ll do it perfectly without producing casualties!  Make sure you don\\u2019t cry in front of me this time.  Are you going to hold that over my head forever?  Just like a woman\\u2026  I-I feel like I don\\u2019t really have my place in this.  I\\u2019ll take care of all of you at once!  Here it comes!  Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands  The distance created between us became too big,  because we were always together  Your honest reply, \\u201cSee you\\u2026\\u201d  coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.  If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying  Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I\\u2019m not by your side  Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands  I can feel it so close,  Our two hearts  Sealed Sand: The Counterattack!  To think you\\u2019d ask the Leaf Village for help\\u2026  I guess the Sand has lost the edge they used to have, huh?  Why are you here?  You know, dogs.  They\\u2019re not satisfied until a favor has been properly returned.  Especially this Akamaru!  A dog retuning a favor doesn\\u2019t have much of a ring to it!  Help is on the way to the other two as well.  You concentrate on this fight!  You\\u2019re giving me lip!  So you flies are gonna gang up on me, huh?  But you\\u2019re no match for my Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.  Eat this!  If your Chakra isn't built up, your sand is no big deal at all!  It\\u2019ll only be useful for blinding me at best!  It\\u2019s futile!  I feel it. Your Chakra is being sucked up.  What?! He was setting the sand in the gourd aside?!  I was being cautious, but he is much too strong.  Gaara Sensei!  Just what I\\u2019d expect from Gaara of the Sand.  He\\u2019s not called the ultimate weapon for nothing\\u2026  The ultimate\\u2026weapon?!  However, he cannot exceed our Ninja tools  forged in the Village of the Artisans!  Gaara!  Hey, he\\u2019s totally got the edge!  Do we have a chance to return the favor?  That\\u2019s incredible wind. What an amount of Chakra\\u2026  No, it seems that sword is amplifying her Chakra.  So she\\u2019s relying on that sword for all of her attack and defense, huh?  Anyway, we\\u2019ve got to slip within firing range for our Jutsu  and stop her movements!  Right.  Let\\u2019s go at once!  Annoying!  She\\u2019s attempting to maintain her distance just from Temari.  I see.  So she just wants to pay attention to the long range-type Temari and  blow us mid-range Jutsu users away with wind  before we can get close, huh\\u2026?  Now then, what should we do?  Man Beast Clone!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Crow!  \\u2013 Arms! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Fang Over Fang!  Did you guys come to get in my way?!  We made sure to send you a signal, right?!  How could I tell?!  We don\\u2019t click at all?  Are you guys\\u2026messing around?!  Be more serious and die!  Talking nonsense!  Although I reduced the damage with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still\\u2026  Just what I\\u2019d expect of Gaara,  the Sand\\u2019s ultimate weapon who hosts the Shukaku\\u2026  But you\\u2019re already in our hands.  What should I do? She\\u2019s beyond the range of my Jutsu\\u2026  and I don\\u2019t see anything around here that could be used to extend my shadow.  Hey!  What\\u2019re you whispering about?  What\\u2019re you thinking?!  I\\u2019ll explain later, for crying out loud. Can you do it or not?  I suppose I could try, but\\u2026  What is it\\u2026?  What\\u2019s he doing?  Behold the terror of Ninja tools our village created.  What\\u2019s this Chakra?  This is a water vein!  I get it!  The lines connecting the point in the center and triangle isn\\u2019t a Barrier\\u2026  It\\u2019s a water vein!  Ninja Tool Barrier: Reverse Scale Formation\\u2026 Activate!  Oh no!  Gaara Sensei!  The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation was a single point, Gaara from the start!  Our swords accurately pierce a water vein  and summon the water dragon.  Sand has sucked up a large amount of water  and has become as heavy as lead\\u2026  Now Gaara can no longer use sand.  Gaara!  \\u2013 Gaara! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Calm down!  Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara!  That guy is?!  They\\u2019ll save Gaara, no matter what.  We need to concentrate on the enemy in front of us.  To think you\\u2019d choose a sandy area to fall on\\u2026  Just what I\\u2019d expect of Gaara of the desert\\u2026  However!  That\\u2019s as far as your useless resistance goes!  Leaf Hurricane!  A hero\\u2019s turn always comes late!  That\\u2019s right!  Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara!  Naruto\\u2026!  It seems you rushed to everyone during the Sasuke incident\\u2026  This time we\\u2019ve come to return the favor from that time.  So we\\u2019ll take that guy on!  You hurry to your student straight on!  To think he\\u2019d corner you this far\\u2026  \\u2013 Lee! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Sakura!  Leave Gaara\\u2019s treatment to me! Lee, you go with Naruto!  \\u2013 Sakura! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Got it!  Then I\\u2019ll be going first!  Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra!  I\\u2019ll suck up all of your Chakra!  I see. So this means we can\\u2019t release our regular power?  That doesn\\u2019t matter!  Even without Chakra, we\\u2019ve got fighting spirit!  Yes! We\\u2019ll go with that plus willpower!  Just as I thought.  That they haven\\u2019t launched anything during the fight thus far means  the two reinforcements don\\u2019t have long range-type Jutsu.  Then I\\u2019ll maintain this distance and\\u2026  you\\u2019ll die getting torn up by the wind!  While she\\u2019s distracted by Shikamaru and the others,  I\\u2019ll just go for it!  Mind Destruction\\u2026!  Ino!  Foolish girl. It\\u2019s useless to attempt to exploit an opening!  You little!  You won\\u2019t get close to me! I\\u2019ve read your range as well!  I don\\u2019t know about that\\u2026!  Ino! You stay right there!  I\\u2019m counting on you\\u2026!  Shino! Sakura!  There\\u2019s one wounded at the waterfall.  Tunneling Fang!  Now!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Oh\\u2026!  What\\u2019re you doing?!  Are you guys\\u2026mocking me?  After sucking up all of your Chakra, I\\u2019ll be returning the favor plenty!  The contusion treatment is complete.  But, the depletion of Chakra is overwhelming.  Contact from your friends\\u2026?  \\u2013 Ino\\u2019s hurt?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Go!  Wha--?! But in your condition\\u2026  I\\u2019m okay now. Help your friend!  Okay. Don\\u2019t push yourself.  Yeah\\u2026  What\\u2019re you doing?! Hurry up and go after your comrade!  I\\u2019ll help my comrade.  I\\u2019ll settle this in a moment.  But\\u2026  Bushy Brow!  Damn it. It\\u2019s no good just shot-gunning it!  It\\u2019s just him?  A part of Black Ant\\u2026  Could it be\\u2026a signal?  Fang Over Fang once more!  Back me up with Crow!  I\\u2019m counting on you for back up too, Choji!  Got it!  Heh! Bossing me around.  The counterattack starts now!  It\\u2019s futile. Your Jutsu won\\u2019t reach me!  You never know until you try, right\\u2026?!  Here we go!  Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe!  Huh?!  What\\u2019re you aiming at?! Totally misguided\\u2026  Say what?  What\\u2019s the meaning of this?  I\\u2019m sure I\\u2019d read your range already\\u2026!  I\\u2019ll show you!  I can create a shadow with this thick a current  even if the water\\u2019s clear.  My Jutsu\\u2019s range has infinitely improved by lifting the waterfall!  The Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!  Summoning\\u2026  Blade Dance!  This one\\u2019s done!  Good grief\\u2026  I\\u2026couldn\\u2019t do anything.  Here everyone\\u2019s doing their best\\u2026  Only I\\u2026  Ino?  Gaara.  You don\\u2019t have any sand left you can use.  What\\u2019s this?!  He smashed the Sand Armor.  No way! But the sand heavy with water like that\\u2026  If I just suck up the Chakra\\u2026  This is my weapon!  You okay, Gaara?!  This is the finishing blow\\u2026  Gaara Sensei!  Hurry! Leave the rest to us!  Man Beast Clone!  Fang Over Fang!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Annoying buzzing flies!  Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword!  What?!  Oh, no!  Puppet Show\\u2026  Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!  The show\\u2019s  over!  \\u2013 We did it! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Yeah!  Matsuri.  Gaara and\\u2026!  A Shinobi carrying a child on his back.  He\\u2019s heading for the valley.  The last one\\u2026  Gaara is chasing him!  What?!  You okay, Bushy Brow? Sakura will be right back.  Thanks.  Well, I\\u2019m going after Gaara!  Got it! I\\u2019ll meet up with you later!  I\\u2019ve got him cornered.  Matsuri.  The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door  Will always be smiling right near by  Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it  Because I want to find the joy without a shape  This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,  I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds  We stand here today because of what we believed through,  That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away  Even if I\\u2019m told that there is no bright future  I\\u2019ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling  The wind is probably testing our hearts  In my heart, I gently grasped my hands  You are probably searching for the answer to your tears  Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands  The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door  Will always be smiling right near by  I heard you figured out the identities of the Four Celestials?  Yes. They are the Ninja of the Village of the Artisans  who've been harboring ill feeling toward the Five Great Nations.  It seems they\\u2019ve completed the forbidden project  passed down in the village and  intend to resurrect their ultimate weapon.  I see. I take it the other villagers got wind of it and evacuated.  Exactly. You head over to where they are immediately.  Yes, ma\\u2019am.

Awesome\\u2026  The Chakra is clearly visible to the naked eye\\u2026  What in the world is happening?!  Don\\u2019t tell me that he learned that Jutsu\\u2026!  So this is the Uchiha Clan\\u2026  Exactly\\u2026  W-What the heck is that?!  What a sound! What\\u2019s that technique?  That\\u2019s just a jab\\u2026  Huh?!  However, it is the one used by Leaf Village\\u2019s number one technician.  That\\u2019s the only original technique of the Copy Ninja, Kakashi\\u2026  It\\u2019s the special technique used only for assassinations\\u2026  Its secret is in the speed of the jab,  and also the physical aptitude that gives forth a gigantic Chakra,  the ability of the Chakra to focus solely on the target,  and moreover the speed of the jab makes a \\u201cchichichichichi\\u201d sound\\u2026  A unique sound attack similar to the rumbling of a thousand birds.  And that\\u2019s why that technique is called\\u2026  Chidori: One Thousand Birds!  No way! That Gaara\\u2019s absolute protection is\\u2026  It\\u2019s impossible\\u2026  Don\\u2019t tell me\\u2026  Excellent work\\u2026  That\\u2019s\\u2026  Kakashi\\u2019s\\u2026  Chidori\\u2026 Also known as Lightning Blade.  Lightning Blade?  Lightning Blade is another name for the Jutsu derived  from Kakashi\\u2019s ability to cut through lightning using that technique.  Huh? Cut through lightning?  Huh? That sounds fishy\\u2026  A-Awesome\\u2026  The real name of that technique is Chidori\\u2026  The secret is the speed of his jab that surpasses any human limitations  and the intensity of the Chakra on his arm\\u2026  And that arm turns virtually into the equivalent of the swing  of a celebrated sword that cuts through everything.  But what a reckless technique\\u2026  That\\u2019s not for you to say\\u2026  Right, Lee?  It\\u2019s beyond my scope of comprehension, but\\u2026  What an awesome technique!  I can understand it\\u2026  If it were me, if I made a running start at that speed,  I wouldn\\u2019t make a direct jab attack on the opponent\\u2026  Or rather, I couldn\\u2019t.  For an opponent,  a straight line attack just gives him an easy chance to launch a counterblow.  And moreover, I don\\u2019t have the eyes to read that counterblow.  I envy you\\u2026Sasuke!  When I fought you once, I said\\u2026  Even if one understands visually,  it\\u2019s meaningless unless one can move physically\\u2026  I was filled with a feeling of superiority.  But now, you have a body that moves at the same high speed as mine.  Moreover, you have\\u2026  the Sharingan!  I caught you!  Third Squadron. We are ready any time.  All preparations are complete on this end too.  Roger. Proceed with action at the signal.  Looks like it\\u2019s almost time.  The guy who was worrying about Sasuke until just a moment ago\\u2026  is now jealous of him.  Sasuke\\u2026  This is the feeling!  Summoning Jutsu!  I\\u2019ve gotten stronger\\u2026  In order to become Hokage\\u2026  In order not to lose to anyone\\u2026  Sasuke!  In order not to lose to you.  I want\\u2026to fight you, too.  But you are\\u2026  Yeah\\u2026  What\\u2026? This warm thing\\u2026?  Mother\\u2026? What is\\u2026?  Blood\\u2026my blood is\\u2026!  D-Don\\u2019t tell me that\\u2026  D-Don\\u2019t tell me that Gaara is hurt?!  What is it?!  It\\u2019s that thing\\u2019s arm!  Darn! Doing something careless like that\\u2026  Has the Perfect Possession happened?  I don\\u2019t know. He seems to be injured\\u2026  This has never happened before.  It gives me the chills just to remember\\u2026  When I first saw that thing, I wasn\\u2019t able to eat\\u2026  I mean, visually it\\u2019s totally\\u2026  What is\\u2026  this sensation?  He\\u2019s hurt, after all\\u2026  The shell was broken when his body was incomplete!  It\\u2019s different! Those aren\\u2019t the eyes!  W-What was that\\u2026 that look earlier on?!  Huh\\u2026?  What\\u2019s this\\u2026? I can\\u2019t see\\u2026  Kakashi! This must be!  Yeah\\u2026a Genjutsu!  \\u2013 Release! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Release!  What\\u2019s going on\\u2026?  Release!  Genjutsu! ls Kabuto already moving?  In that case, it\\u2019s just about time\\u2026  It\\u2019s coming!  Shall we begin?!  It\\u2019s the signal!  \\u2013 Start the operation! \\u2013 Start the operation!  Everyone makes mistakes lt\\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about  Don\\u2019t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile  Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump  If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you  So many regrets Don\\u2019t let this scar be for naught  Let\\u2019s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it\\u2019s Show Time, life begins now.  Everyone makes mistakes  It\\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about  Don\\u2019t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile  Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on  Forge on strong  It got dark all of a sudden\\u2026 it feels so good.  I hear something in the distance.  Sakura\\u2019s voice, Kakashi Sensei\\u2019s voice\\u2026  Scream? I just heard something loud.  I think I do, but\\u2026 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSasuke\\u2026  I got to watch his match!  But I really don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on.  Next time: \\u201cZero Hour! The Destruction of \\t\\tthe Hidden Leaf Village Begins!\\u201d  What in the world is going on?! \",\n          \"To think the Leaf\\u2019s reinforcements will be you of all people!  A man should always repay the debt he owes a woman.  Always the bothersome guy with the man and woman stuff!  Gaara and Kankuro are chasing after the guys who took our village girl.  Forget about here and head for them!  We\\u2019ve received information.  Gaara and Kankuro have entered their respective battles.  I see\\u2026  The shadow won\\u2019t reach, I guess\\u2026  Leaf Village\\u2019s two-man cells are just now heading there for back-up.  How well prepared.  It\\u2019s a pain,  but as long as we\\u2019re doing this, we\\u2019ll do it right.  We\\u2019ll do it perfectly without producing casualties!  Make sure you don\\u2019t cry in front of me this time.  Are you going to hold that over my head forever?  Just like a woman\\u2026  I-I feel like I don\\u2019t really have my place in this.  I\\u2019ll take care of all of you at once!  Here it comes!  Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands  The distance created between us became too big,  because we were always together  Your honest reply, \\u201cSee you\\u2026\\u201d  coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.  If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying  Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I\\u2019m not by your side  Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands  I can feel it so close,  Our two hearts  Sealed Sand: The Counterattack!  To think you\\u2019d ask the Leaf Village for help\\u2026  I guess the Sand has lost the edge they used to have, huh?  Why are you here?  You know, dogs.  They\\u2019re not satisfied until a favor has been properly returned.  Especially this Akamaru!  A dog retuning a favor doesn\\u2019t have much of a ring to it!  Help is on the way to the other two as well.  You concentrate on this fight!  You\\u2019re giving me lip!  So you flies are gonna gang up on me, huh?  But you\\u2019re no match for my Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.  Eat this!  If your Chakra isn't built up, your sand is no big deal at all!  It\\u2019ll only be useful for blinding me at best!  It\\u2019s futile!  I feel it. Your Chakra is being sucked up.  What?! He was setting the sand in the gourd aside?!  I was being cautious, but he is much too strong.  Gaara Sensei!  Just what I\\u2019d expect from Gaara of the Sand.  He\\u2019s not called the ultimate weapon for nothing\\u2026  The ultimate\\u2026weapon?!  However, he cannot exceed our Ninja tools  forged in the Village of the Artisans!  Gaara!  Hey, he\\u2019s totally got the edge!  Do we have a chance to return the favor?  That\\u2019s incredible wind. What an amount of Chakra\\u2026  No, it seems that sword is amplifying her Chakra.  So she\\u2019s relying on that sword for all of her attack and defense, huh?  Anyway, we\\u2019ve got to slip within firing range for our Jutsu  and stop her movements!  Right.  Let\\u2019s go at once!  Annoying!  She\\u2019s attempting to maintain her distance just from Temari.  I see.  So she just wants to pay attention to the long range-type Temari and  blow us mid-range Jutsu users away with wind  before we can get close, huh\\u2026?  Now then, what should we do?  Man Beast Clone!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Crow!  \\u2013 Arms! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Fang Over Fang!  Did you guys come to get in my way?!  We made sure to send you a signal, right?!  How could I tell?!  We don\\u2019t click at all?  Are you guys\\u2026messing around?!  Be more serious and die!  Talking nonsense!  Although I reduced the damage with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still\\u2026  Just what I\\u2019d expect of Gaara,  the Sand\\u2019s ultimate weapon who hosts the Shukaku\\u2026  But you\\u2019re already in our hands.  What should I do? She\\u2019s beyond the range of my Jutsu\\u2026  and I don\\u2019t see anything around here that could be used to extend my shadow.  Hey!  What\\u2019re you whispering about?  What\\u2019re you thinking?!  I\\u2019ll explain later, for crying out loud. Can you do it or not?  I suppose I could try, but\\u2026  What is it\\u2026?  What\\u2019s he doing?  Behold the terror of Ninja tools our village created.  What\\u2019s this Chakra?  This is a water vein!  I get it!  The lines connecting the point in the center and triangle isn\\u2019t a Barrier\\u2026  It\\u2019s a water vein!  Ninja Tool Barrier: Reverse Scale Formation\\u2026 Activate!  Oh no!  Gaara Sensei!  The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation was a single point, Gaara from the start!  Our swords accurately pierce a water vein  and summon the water dragon.  Sand has sucked up a large amount of water  and has become as heavy as lead\\u2026  Now Gaara can no longer use sand.  Gaara!  \\u2013 Gaara! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Calm down!  Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara!  That guy is?!  They\\u2019ll save Gaara, no matter what.  We need to concentrate on the enemy in front of us.  To think you\\u2019d choose a sandy area to fall on\\u2026  Just what I\\u2019d expect of Gaara of the desert\\u2026  However!  That\\u2019s as far as your useless resistance goes!  Leaf Hurricane!  A hero\\u2019s turn always comes late!  That\\u2019s right!  Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara!  Naruto\\u2026!  It seems you rushed to everyone during the Sasuke incident\\u2026  This time we\\u2019ve come to return the favor from that time.  So we\\u2019ll take that guy on!  You hurry to your student straight on!  To think he\\u2019d corner you this far\\u2026  \\u2013 Lee! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Sakura!  Leave Gaara\\u2019s treatment to me! Lee, you go with Naruto!  \\u2013 Sakura! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Got it!  Then I\\u2019ll be going first!  Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra!  I\\u2019ll suck up all of your Chakra!  I see. So this means we can\\u2019t release our regular power?  That doesn\\u2019t matter!  Even without Chakra, we\\u2019ve got fighting spirit!  Yes! We\\u2019ll go with that plus willpower!  Just as I thought.  That they haven\\u2019t launched anything during the fight thus far means  the two reinforcements don\\u2019t have long range-type Jutsu.  Then I\\u2019ll maintain this distance and\\u2026  you\\u2019ll die getting torn up by the wind!  While she\\u2019s distracted by Shikamaru and the others,  I\\u2019ll just go for it!  Mind Destruction\\u2026!  Ino!  Foolish girl. It\\u2019s useless to attempt to exploit an opening!  You little!  You won\\u2019t get close to me! I\\u2019ve read your range as well!  I don\\u2019t know about that\\u2026!  Ino! You stay right there!  I\\u2019m counting on you\\u2026!  Shino! Sakura!  There\\u2019s one wounded at the waterfall.  Tunneling Fang!  Now!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Oh\\u2026!  What\\u2019re you doing?!  Are you guys\\u2026mocking me?  After sucking up all of your Chakra, I\\u2019ll be returning the favor plenty!  The contusion treatment is complete.  But, the depletion of Chakra is overwhelming.  Contact from your friends\\u2026?  \\u2013 Ino\\u2019s hurt?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Go!  Wha--?! But in your condition\\u2026  I\\u2019m okay now. Help your friend!  Okay. Don\\u2019t push yourself.  Yeah\\u2026  What\\u2019re you doing?! Hurry up and go after your comrade!  I\\u2019ll help my comrade.  I\\u2019ll settle this in a moment.  But\\u2026  Bushy Brow!  Damn it. It\\u2019s no good just shot-gunning it!  It\\u2019s just him?  A part of Black Ant\\u2026  Could it be\\u2026a signal?  Fang Over Fang once more!  Back me up with Crow!  I\\u2019m counting on you for back up too, Choji!  Got it!  Heh! Bossing me around.  The counterattack starts now!  It\\u2019s futile. Your Jutsu won\\u2019t reach me!  You never know until you try, right\\u2026?!  Here we go!  Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe!  Huh?!  What\\u2019re you aiming at?! Totally misguided\\u2026  Say what?  What\\u2019s the meaning of this?  I\\u2019m sure I\\u2019d read your range already\\u2026!  I\\u2019ll show you!  I can create a shadow with this thick a current  even if the water\\u2019s clear.  My Jutsu\\u2019s range has infinitely improved by lifting the waterfall!  The Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!  Summoning\\u2026  Blade Dance!  This one\\u2019s done!  Good grief\\u2026  I\\u2026couldn\\u2019t do anything.  Here everyone\\u2019s doing their best\\u2026  Only I\\u2026  Ino?  Gaara.  You don\\u2019t have any sand left you can use.  What\\u2019s this?!  He smashed the Sand Armor.  No way! But the sand heavy with water like that\\u2026  If I just suck up the Chakra\\u2026  This is my weapon!  You okay, Gaara?!  This is the finishing blow\\u2026  Gaara Sensei!  Hurry! Leave the rest to us!  Man Beast Clone!  Fang Over Fang!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Annoying buzzing flies!  Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword!  What?!  Oh, no!  Puppet Show\\u2026  Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!  The show\\u2019s  over!  \\u2013 We did it! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Yeah!  Matsuri.  Gaara and\\u2026!  A Shinobi carrying a child on his back.  He\\u2019s heading for the valley.  The last one\\u2026  Gaara is chasing him!  What?!  You okay, Bushy Brow? Sakura will be right back.  Thanks.  Well, I\\u2019m going after Gaara!  Got it! I\\u2019ll meet up with you later!  I\\u2019ve got him cornered.  Matsuri.  The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door  Will always be smiling right near by  Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it  Because I want to find the joy without a shape  This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,  I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds  We stand here today because of what we believed through,  That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away  Even if I\\u2019m told that there is no bright future  I\\u2019ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling  The wind is probably testing our hearts  In my heart, I gently grasped my hands  You are probably searching for the answer to your tears  Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands  The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door  Will always be smiling right near by  I heard you figured out the identities of the Four Celestials?  Yes. They are the Ninja of the Village of the Artisans  who've been harboring ill feeling toward the Five Great Nations.  It seems they\\u2019ve completed the forbidden project  passed down in the village and  intend to resurrect their ultimate weapon.  I see. I take it the other villagers got wind of it and evacuated.

This thing of mine also takes time!  Hey, is something the matter?  No\\u2026  It must be my imagination\\u2026  Hurry up!  Sensei\\u2026  Hm?  What did you mean when you said that you didn\\u2019t get here late for nothing?  Hmm\\u2026  You want to know why?  Like I said, this isn\\u2019t the time to be talking about that!  Shut up and watch him.  \\u2018Cause you\\u2019ll get a real surprise.  That idiot\\u2026  Gaara\\u2026we never know when the signal is going to come!  Yeah\\u2026 I\\u2019m gonna tear him open.  That\\u2019s how it comes out. What?  The contents\\u2026  Lots and lots are coming out, right?  I\\u2019ll give it all to you.  I\\u2019m always a good boy!  Yeah, let\\u2019s do it.  Mother, I\\u2019m watching so\\u2026  Darn! He\\u2019s totally useless, no matter what we do now.  He\\u2019s not even abiding by the plan.  He looks like he\\u2019s just going to screw things up!  That Gaara!  Hey, hey, wouldn\\u2019t it be better if we flee\\u2026?  Plan\\u2026?  How\\u2019s it going?  All preparations are proceeding in accordance with the timeline.  Please hurry up with preparation for Summoning.  I want to be sure we\\u2019re able to make our move at any time.  Understood!  All right, I\\u2019ll leave that to you.  D-Don\\u2019t tell me that\\u2026  The reason I decided to train Sasuke was\\u2026  because he was like me.  A physical Activation?!  I see\\u2026  That\\u2019s why he went through the physical training  and increased his speed significantly\\u2026!  That\\u2019s right!  Awesome\\u2026  The Chakra is clearly visible to the naked eye\\u2026  What in the world is happening?!  Don\\u2019t tell me that he learned that Jutsu\\u2026!  So this is the Uchiha Clan\\u2026  Exactly\\u2026  W-What the heck is that?!  What a sound! What\\u2019s that technique?  That\\u2019s just a jab\\u2026  Huh?!  However, it is the one used by Leaf Village\\u2019s number one technician.  That\\u2019s the only original technique of the Copy Ninja, Kakashi\\u2026  It\\u2019s the special technique used only for assassinations\\u2026  Its secret is in the speed of the jab,  and also the physical aptitude that gives forth a gigantic Chakra,  the ability of the Chakra to focus solely on the target,  and moreover the speed of the jab makes a \\u201cchichichichichi\\u201d sound\\u2026  A unique sound attack similar to the rumbling of a thousand birds.  And that\\u2019s why that technique is called\\u2026  Chidori: One Thousand Birds!  No way! That Gaara\\u2019s absolute protection is\\u2026  It\\u2019s impossible\\u2026  Don\\u2019t tell me\\u2026  Excellent work\\u2026  That\\u2019s\\u2026  Kakashi\\u2019s\\u2026  Chidori\\u2026 Also known as Lightning Blade.  Lightning Blade?  Lightning Blade is another name for the Jutsu derived  from Kakashi\\u2019s ability to cut through lightning using that technique.  Huh? Cut through lightning?  Huh? That sounds fishy\\u2026  A-Awesome\\u2026  The real name of that technique is Chidori\\u2026  The secret is the speed of his jab that surpasses any human limitations  and the intensity of the Chakra on his arm\\u2026  And that arm turns virtually into the equivalent of the swing  of a celebrated sword that cuts through everything.  But what a reckless technique\\u2026  That\\u2019s not for you to say\\u2026  Right, Lee?  It\\u2019s beyond my scope of comprehension, but\\u2026  What an awesome technique!  I can understand it\\u2026  If it were me, if I made a running start at that speed,  I wouldn\\u2019t make a direct jab attack on the opponent\\u2026  Or rather, I couldn\\u2019t.  For an opponent,  a straight line attack just gives him an easy chance to launch a counterblow.  And moreover, I don\\u2019t have the eyes to read that counterblow.  I envy you\\u2026Sasuke!  When I fought you once, I said\\u2026  Even if one understands visually,  it\\u2019s meaningless unless one can move physically\\u2026  I was filled with a feeling of superiority.  But now, you have a body that moves at the same high speed as mine.  Moreover, you have\\u2026  the Sharingan!  I caught you!  Third Squadron. We are ready any time.  All preparations are complete on this end too.  Roger. Proceed with action at the signal.  Looks like it\\u2019s almost time.  The guy who was worrying about Sasuke until just a moment ago\\u2026  is now jealous of him.  Sasuke\\u2026  This is the feeling!  Summoning Jutsu!  I\\u2019ve gotten stronger\\u2026  In order to become Hokage\\u2026  In order not to lose to anyone\\u2026  Sasuke!  In order not to lose to you.  I want\\u2026to fight you, too.  But you are\\u2026  Yeah\\u2026  What\\u2026? This warm thing\\u2026?  Mother\\u2026? What is\\u2026?  Blood\\u2026my blood is\\u2026!  D-Don\\u2019t tell me that\\u2026  D-Don\\u2019t tell me that Gaara is hurt?!  What is it?!  It\\u2019s that thing\\u2019s arm!  Darn! Doing something careless like that\\u2026  Has the Perfect Possession happened?  I don\\u2019t know. He seems to be injured\\u2026  This has never happened before.  It gives me the chills just to remember\\u2026  When I first saw that thing, I wasn\\u2019t able to eat\\u2026  I mean, visually it\\u2019s totally\\u2026  What is\\u2026  this sensation?  He\\u2019s hurt, after all\\u2026  The shell was broken when his body was incomplete!  It\\u2019s different! Those aren\\u2019t the eyes!  W-What was that\\u2026 that look earlier on?!  Huh\\u2026?  What\\u2019s this\\u2026? I can\\u2019t see\\u2026  Kakashi! This must be!  Yeah\\u2026a Genjutsu!  \\u2013 Release! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Release!  What\\u2019s going on\\u2026?  Release!  Genjutsu! ls Kabuto already moving?  In that case, it\\u2019s just about time\\u2026  It\\u2019s coming!  Shall we begin?!  It\\u2019s the signal!  \\u2013 Start the operation! \\u2013 Start the operation!  Everyone makes mistakes lt\\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about  Don\\u2019t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile  Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump  If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you  So many regrets Don\\u2019t let this scar be for naught  Let\\u2019s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it\\u2019s Show Time, life begins now.  Everyone makes mistakes  It\\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about  Don\\u2019t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile  Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on  Forge on strong  It got dark all of a sudden\\u2026 it feels so good.  I hear something in the distance.  Sakura\\u2019s voice, Kakashi Sensei\\u2019s voice\\u2026  Scream? I just heard something loud.  I think I do, but\\u2026 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSasuke\\u2026  I got to watch his match!  But I really don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on.  Next time: \\u201cZero Hour! The Destruction of \\t\\tthe Hidden Leaf Village Begins!\\u201d  What in the world is going on?! \",\n          \"To think the Leaf\\u2019s reinforcements will be you of all people!  A man should always repay the debt he owes a woman.  Always the bothersome guy with the man and woman stuff!  Gaara and Kankuro are chasing after the guys who took our village girl.  Forget about here and head for them!  We\\u2019ve received information.  Gaara and Kankuro have entered their respective battles.  I see\\u2026  The shadow won\\u2019t reach, I guess\\u2026  Leaf Village\\u2019s two-man cells are just now heading there for back-up.  How well prepared.  It\\u2019s a pain,  but as long as we\\u2019re doing this, we\\u2019ll do it right.  We\\u2019ll do it perfectly without producing casualties!  Make sure you don\\u2019t cry in front of me this time.  Are you going to hold that over my head forever?  Just like a woman\\u2026  I-I feel like I don\\u2019t really have my place in this.  I\\u2019ll take care of all of you at once!  Here it comes!  Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands  The distance created between us became too big,  because we were always together  Your honest reply, \\u201cSee you\\u2026\\u201d  coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.  If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying  Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I\\u2019m not by your side  Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands  I can feel it so close,  Our two hearts  Sealed Sand: The Counterattack!  To think you\\u2019d ask the Leaf Village for help\\u2026  I guess the Sand has lost the edge they used to have, huh?  Why are you here?  You know, dogs.  They\\u2019re not satisfied until a favor has been properly returned.  Especially this Akamaru!  A dog retuning a favor doesn\\u2019t have much of a ring to it!  Help is on the way to the other two as well.  You concentrate on this fight!  You\\u2019re giving me lip!  So you flies are gonna gang up on me, huh?  But you\\u2019re no match for my Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.  Eat this!  If your Chakra isn't built up, your sand is no big deal at all!  It\\u2019ll only be useful for blinding me at best!  It\\u2019s futile!  I feel it. Your Chakra is being sucked up.  What?! He was setting the sand in the gourd aside?!  I was being cautious, but he is much too strong.  Gaara Sensei!  Just what I\\u2019d expect from Gaara of the Sand.  He\\u2019s not called the ultimate weapon for nothing\\u2026  The ultimate\\u2026weapon?!  However, he cannot exceed our Ninja tools  forged in the Village of the Artisans!  Gaara!  Hey, he\\u2019s totally got the edge!  Do we have a chance to return the favor?  That\\u2019s incredible wind. What an amount of Chakra\\u2026  No, it seems that sword is amplifying her Chakra.  So she\\u2019s relying on that sword for all of her attack and defense, huh?  Anyway, we\\u2019ve got to slip within firing range for our Jutsu  and stop her movements!  Right.  Let\\u2019s go at once!  Annoying!  She\\u2019s attempting to maintain her distance just from Temari.  I see.  So she just wants to pay attention to the long range-type Temari and  blow us mid-range Jutsu users away with wind  before we can get close, huh\\u2026?  Now then, what should we do?  Man Beast Clone!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Crow!  \\u2013 Arms! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Fang Over Fang!  Did you guys come to get in my way?!  We made sure to send you a signal, right?!  How could I tell?!  We don\\u2019t click at all?  Are you guys\\u2026messing around?!  Be more serious and die!  Talking nonsense!  Although I reduced the damage with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still\\u2026  Just what I\\u2019d expect of Gaara,  the Sand\\u2019s ultimate weapon who hosts the Shukaku\\u2026  But you\\u2019re already in our hands.  What should I do? She\\u2019s beyond the range of my Jutsu\\u2026  and I don\\u2019t see anything around here that could be used to extend my shadow.  Hey!  What\\u2019re you whispering about?  What\\u2019re you thinking?!  I\\u2019ll explain later, for crying out loud. Can you do it or not?  I suppose I could try, but\\u2026  What is it\\u2026?  What\\u2019s he doing?  Behold the terror of Ninja tools our village created.  What\\u2019s this Chakra?  This is a water vein!  I get it!  The lines connecting the point in the center and triangle isn\\u2019t a Barrier\\u2026  It\\u2019s a water vein!  Ninja Tool Barrier: Reverse Scale Formation\\u2026 Activate!  Oh no!  Gaara Sensei!  The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation was a single point, Gaara from the start!  Our swords accurately pierce a water vein  and summon the water dragon.  Sand has sucked up a large amount of water  and has become as heavy as lead\\u2026  Now Gaara can no longer use sand.  Gaara!  \\u2013 Gaara! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Calm down!  Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara!  That guy is?!  They\\u2019ll save Gaara, no matter what.  We need to concentrate on the enemy in front of us.  To think you\\u2019d choose a sandy area to fall on\\u2026  Just what I\\u2019d expect of Gaara of the desert\\u2026  However!  That\\u2019s as far as your useless resistance goes!  Leaf Hurricane!  A hero\\u2019s turn always comes late!  That\\u2019s right!  Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara!  Naruto\\u2026!  It seems you rushed to everyone during the Sasuke incident\\u2026  This time we\\u2019ve come to return the favor from that time.  So we\\u2019ll take that guy on!  You hurry to your student straight on!  To think he\\u2019d corner you this far\\u2026  \\u2013 Lee! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Sakura!  Leave Gaara\\u2019s treatment to me! Lee, you go with Naruto!  \\u2013 Sakura! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Got it!  Then I\\u2019ll be going first!  Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra!  I\\u2019ll suck up all of your Chakra!  I see. So this means we can\\u2019t release our regular power?  That doesn\\u2019t matter!  Even without Chakra, we\\u2019ve got fighting spirit!  Yes! We\\u2019ll go with that plus willpower!  Just as I thought.  That they haven\\u2019t launched anything during the fight thus far means  the two reinforcements don\\u2019t have long range-type Jutsu.  Then I\\u2019ll maintain this distance and\\u2026  you\\u2019ll die getting torn up by the wind!  While she\\u2019s distracted by Shikamaru and the others,  I\\u2019ll just go for it!  Mind Destruction\\u2026!  Ino!  Foolish girl. It\\u2019s useless to attempt to exploit an opening!  You little!  You won\\u2019t get close to me! I\\u2019ve read your range as well!  I don\\u2019t know about that\\u2026!  Ino! You stay right there!  I\\u2019m counting on you\\u2026!  Shino! Sakura!  There\\u2019s one wounded at the waterfall.  Tunneling Fang!  Now!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Oh\\u2026!  What\\u2019re you doing?!  Are you guys\\u2026mocking me?  After sucking up all of your Chakra, I\\u2019ll be returning the favor plenty!  The contusion treatment is complete.  But, the depletion of Chakra is overwhelming.  Contact from your friends\\u2026?  \\u2013 Ino\\u2019s hurt?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Go!  Wha--?! But in your condition\\u2026  I\\u2019m okay now. Help your friend!  Okay. Don\\u2019t push yourself.  Yeah\\u2026  What\\u2019re you doing?! Hurry up and go after your comrade!  I\\u2019ll help my comrade.  I\\u2019ll settle this in a moment.  But\\u2026  Bushy Brow!  Damn it. It\\u2019s no good just shot-gunning it!  It\\u2019s just him?  A part of Black Ant\\u2026  Could it be\\u2026a signal?  Fang Over Fang once more!  Back me up with Crow!  I\\u2019m counting on you for back up too, Choji!  Got it!  Heh! Bossing me around.  The counterattack starts now!  It\\u2019s futile. Your Jutsu won\\u2019t reach me!  You never know until you try, right\\u2026?!  Here we go!  Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe!  Huh?!  What\\u2019re you aiming at?! Totally misguided\\u2026  Say what?  What\\u2019s the meaning of this?  I\\u2019m sure I\\u2019d read your range already\\u2026!  I\\u2019ll show you!  I can create a shadow with this thick a current  even if the water\\u2019s clear.  My Jutsu\\u2019s range has infinitely improved by lifting the waterfall!  The Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!  Summoning\\u2026  Blade Dance!  This one\\u2019s done!  Good grief\\u2026  I\\u2026couldn\\u2019t do anything.  Here everyone\\u2019s doing their best\\u2026  Only I\\u2026  Ino?  Gaara.  You don\\u2019t have any sand left you can use.  What\\u2019s this?!  He smashed the Sand Armor.  No way! But the sand heavy with water like that\\u2026  If I just suck up the Chakra\\u2026  This is my weapon!  You okay, Gaara?!  This is the finishing blow\\u2026  Gaara Sensei!  Hurry! Leave the rest to us!  Man Beast Clone!  Fang Over Fang!  Partial Expansion Jutsu!  Annoying buzzing flies!  Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword!  What?!  Oh, no!  Puppet Show\\u2026  Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!  The show\\u2019s  over!  \\u2013 We did it! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Yeah!  Matsuri.  Gaara and\\u2026!  A Shinobi carrying a child on his back.  He\\u2019s heading for the valley.  The last one\\u2026  Gaara is chasing him!  What?!  You okay, Bushy Brow? Sakura will be right back.  Thanks.  Well, I\\u2019m going after Gaara!  Got it! I\\u2019ll meet up with you later!  I\\u2019ve got him cornered.  Matsuri.  The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door  Will always be smiling right near by  Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it  Because I want to find the joy without a shape  This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,  I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds  We stand here today because of what we believed through,  That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away  Even if I\\u2019m told that there is no bright future  I\\u2019ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling  The wind is probably testing our hearts  In my heart, I gently grasped my hands  You are probably searching for the answer to your tears  Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands  The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door  Will always be smiling right near by  I heard you figured out the identities of the Four Celestials?  Yes. They are the Ninja of the Village of the Artisans  who've been harboring ill feeling toward the Five Great Nations.
